# WooCommerce-Barcode
This is a WordPress WooCommerce plugin that adds a barcode field to WooCommerce Products which then can be used together with [WooCommerce POS](http://wcpos.com/)

This plugin is created by RafaÃ«l De Jongh, with great assistance of both [LoicTheAztec](http://stackoverflow.com/users/3730754/loictheaztec) and [Helgatheviking](http://stackoverflow.com/users/383847/helgatheviking) from the StackOverflow Community.

This branch makes a small change in the view of the variation meta boxes, to move the Barcode field above the SKU field. This main file was edited because there wasn't a hook in place that could perform this task out of the box.
